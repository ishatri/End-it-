Just some quick recap of what I study everyday
1. h1 tag , h2 tag , h3 tag and <p></p> tag
2. img does not have a closing tag
use it like this <img src =" " width = "100%>
usually css is used to adjusting the image but width can be used as well
3. div is used to segregate a section in an HTML file helpful when it comes to css tags
4. you can drag a html file directly into browser to open it
5. anchor tag is used to create links insidee an html file
6.
