Just some quick recap of what I study everyday
1. h1 tag , h2 tag , h3 tag and <p></p> tag
2. img does not have a closing tag
use it like this <img src =" " width = "100%>
usually css is used to adjusting the image but width can be used as well
3. div is used to segregate a section in an HTML file helpful when it comes to css tags
4. you can drag a html file directly into browser to open it
5. anchor tag is used to create links insidee an html file
6. alternating websites using html and inspct element
7. <button> tag to make up a signup page but that is pretty useless without input tag
8. input tag behaves just like img tag and has no closing brackets and we use placeholder to specify what kind of information we are supposed to enter there
9. a bit more about the input tag 
<input type=" can be username for username and password when entering passwords" placeholder = "password/username">
type can be time, color, date
10. <input type="file"> cann be used to upload files in html
11. when it comes to anchor tag the basic syntax to use it is given as follow
<a href="https.google.com">
sometimes we wnt the site mentioned by anchor tag to open in another tab for that after href and link just enter target="_blank"
<a href = "websute name" target = "_blank"> the word which serves as the hyperlink </a>
